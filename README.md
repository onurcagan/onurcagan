🙋‍♂️ Hi there! My name is Onur and I'm a web developer from Turkey.

💻 I specialize in building websites and web applications using a variety of languages and frameworks, including:

- Typescript
- React
- C#
- Next.js
- Node.js

🎨 I also have experience working with UI libraries such as Chakra UI and Bootstrap to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

💪 When it comes to my work, I am a problem-solver at heart and always aim to deliver the best possible results for my clients. I am also committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and techniques in web development.

🏃‍♂️ When I'm not coding, you can find me hitting the pavement for a run or lifting weights at the gym. I believe in the importance of maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.

🌍 I am fluent in both English and Turkish and am always open to collaborating with clients from around the world. If you have a project that you think I could help with, don't hesitate to reach out to me via LinkedIn or by email at onurcagann@gmail.com. I look forward to working with you.
